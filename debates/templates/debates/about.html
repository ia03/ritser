      <h1>About MoDebate</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Launched in Spring 2018, MoDebate is a platform made to let people share useful, substantiated information regarding different types of issues (such as politics, history, or even alternative medicine) easily so that it is accessible to the public and can change people's minds in an organized and efficient manner that saves time, reduces the impact of fake news and bias, and is not an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)">echo chamber.</a> Read on if you want to learn more.</p>
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>You likely have participated in a debate at least a few times in your life, whether it was about politics, religion, or even just video game theories. It is also likely that at least some of these debates have not changed someone's mind for the better, whether it was yours or your opponent's. This might seem insignificant, but it uncovers the fact that our decision making processes are generally deeply flawed, which is a <i>very</i> big problem. Our decisions have a very large effect on our lives, and it is very important to rationally assess how we obtain those decisions if we want to make sure they're the "right" ones. Most people ignore the fact that they may be wrong, assume their opponents' decision making processes are flawed, and try to debate others into believing what they believe, but that does not work when these people are wrong and their opponents are right, and results in the ideas these people believe in continuing to survive and thrive. The problem is not that false ideas exist, but rather our decision making processes sometimes lead us to believing them and keeping those beliefs even when challeneged.</p>
    <p>It doesn't help that some platforms whose users debate on are often not built to support debates. People often can and do dislike/downvote their opponents for the sole purpose of disagreeing with them, which means these tools strengthen the effects of many biases such as groupthink and discourage critical thinking. This causes the accuracy of people's opinions to be negatively impacted and generally makes the world worse off.</p>
    <p>Not enough attention is paid to how damaging this is. The way people think and obtain their opinions has a very large effect on the outcomes of political elections in democracies, and it needs to change if we want to bring about real change to the world today.</p>
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>In order to improve the way we obtain our opinions, we first must fully understand it. We will summarize this by listing the 4 main types of factors that affect how we choose our opinions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>our emotions (such as anger or fear)</li>
      <li>our willingness to have these opinions (including our willingness to side with our existing views, possibly taught from birth, so as to not prove ourselves wrong)</li>
      <li>evidence found by us</li>
      <li>other biases that we have (such as confirmation bias)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>All of these factors are <i>subjective</i> (different based on who you are) while the truth is <i>objective</i> (the same regardless of who you are), so there is no way to obtain the truth with 100% certainty. However, only one factor actually helps us find out the truth most of the time, and that is evidence. That means we should try to eliminate the effects of all the other factors by identifying them and countering them, but we should not stop there. Evidence can be forged or falsified, so we must try our best to verify its accuracy. Then we should try to make the only factor left (evidence) as objective as possible (remember, the truth is <i>objective</i>) by making it available to many people without censoring any of it. In theory, if we do all that, we should all reach a consensus on most issues, and the world would be a much better place.</p>
    <p class="text-muted">Note: Sometimes the evidence available regarding a certain issue isn't enough to prove any proposed opinion to be right. That is okay. Having no opinion is sometimes necessary, but remember that the burden of proof always lies on the person who is making the claim.</p>
    <p><strong>It all comes down to getting the notion that you have to win the debate out of your head and replacing it with a desire to learn the truth in coordination with who you are debating. Once your goal is to learn the truth (whatever it may be) rather than confirm your existing beliefs, everything else becomes a lot easier for everyone.</strong></p>
    <h2>Our Role</h2>
    <p>This website was started to make evidence virtually the only factor that affects your opinions, and make it as objective as possible by making the same information available to many people, causing you to form an unbiased judgement on what the objective truth is. We're different from other online discussion forums in the sense that we moderate our content strictly to prevent manipulation, deny unreliable evidence, and most importantly, we structure our debates to promote a better, easier way to think in general.</p>
    <p>Instead of one-on-one debates that incentivize winning the debate using virtual points or social respect, we incentivize posting as many clear and concise useful arguments as possible to public debates regardless of which side they're on. This may seem insignificant, but this means our goal is very different from those of many other debate platforms. Our debates are structured to educate people as efficiently as possible, not to confirm the debaters' existing beliefs.</p>
    <p>Our purpose is not to tell you what to believe, but rather to give you the tools to choose your own beliefs in a bias-free, open-minded way. There are only two ways people can disagree: one person lacks the information another person has or they think differently. Our job is to prevent the former while encouraging you to prevent the latter.</p>
    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> We don't like how pointless (and harmful) most internet/real life arguments are. We've built MoDebate to change that, and we hope to change the future of politics.</p>
