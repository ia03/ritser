      <h1>About MoDebate</h1></div>
    <p>Launched in March 2018, MoDebate is a platform made to let people share useful, substantiated information regarding different types of issues (such as politics, history, or even alternative medicine) easily so that it is accessible to the public and can change people's minds in a structured and efficient manner that saves time, reduces the impact of fake news and bias, and is not an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)">echo chamber.</a> Read on if you want to learn more.</p>
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>You likely have participated in a debate at least a few times in your life, whether it was about politics, religion, or even just video game theories. It is also likely that at least one of these debates neither indirectly nor directly changed someone's mind for the better, whether it was yours or your opponent's. This might seem insignificant, but it uncovers the fact that our decision making processes are generally deeply flawed, which is a <i>very</i> big problem. Our decisions have a very large effect on our lives, and it is very important to rationally assess how we obtain those decisions if we want to make sure they're the "right" ones. Most people ignore the fact that they may be wrong, assume their opponents' decision making processes are flawed, and try to debate others into believing what they believe, but that does not work when these people are wrong and their opponents are right, and results in these ideas continuing to survive and thrive. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The problem is not that false ideas exist, but rather our decision making processes sometimes lead us to believing them.</span></p>
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>In order to improve the way we obtain our opinions, we first must fully understand it. We will summarize this by listing the 4 main types of factors that affect our opinions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>our emotions (such as anger or fear)</li>
      <li>our willingness to have these opinions (including our willingness to side with our existing views, possibly taught from birth, so as to not prove ourselves wrong)</li>
      <li>evidence found by us</li>
      <li>other biases that we have (such as confirmation bias)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As you can see, all of these factors are subjective, so there is no way to obtain the truth with 100% certainty. However, only one factor actually helps us find out the truth most of the time, and that is evidence. That means we should try to eliminate the effects of all the other factors by identifying them and countering them, but we should not stop there. Evidence can be forged or falsified, so we must try our best to verify its accuracy. Not only that, but censorship can prevent us from finding sufficient evidence to prove that a correct idea is in fact correct, so we must try to fight it. In theory, if we do all that, we should all reach a consensus on most issues.</p>
    <p class="text-muted">Note: Sometimes the evidence available regarding a certain issue isn't enough to prove a certain opinion to be right. That is okay. Having no opinion is sometimes necessary, but the burden of proof always lies on the person who is making the claim.</p>
    <p>This website was started to provide an online platform to make bias-free, substantiated information regarding specific issues easily available to the general public and to incentivize them to use that information to think rationally and make up their own minds on these issues. Contributing is encouraged. Keep in mind that we can not change your mind without your help, so check out the rules to use the website to its fullest potential.</p>
