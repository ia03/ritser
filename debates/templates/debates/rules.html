    <p>MoDebate is a website that relies on user generated content and in order to serve our users better, we have created a set of rules for everyone to follow. The ways we deal with content policy violations are listed in their respective subsections.</p>

            Moderators (including owners of topics)

                <li>Must include as much information as possible regarding their actions in the moderator notes</li>

            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="suspensions">Suspensions</h2>
    <p>If a user has violated a rule severely enough, a suspension may be issued by staff. This is temporary and simply means you may not perform the following actions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Vote on a Debate
        </li>
        <li>
            Submit/edit an argument
        </li>
        <li>
            Submit/edit a debate
        </li>
        <li>
            Submit/edit a topic
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="securitylevels">Security Levels</h2>
    <p>Security levels are a featured designed to help combat spam and manipulation. There are two types of security level settings, one for topics (that restricts the submission and visibility of debates), and one for debates (that restricts the submission and visibility of arguments).</p>
    <p>There are three available security level settings to choose from for topics: 0, 1, 2, and 3. For level 0 topics, all users can submit debates. For level 1 topics, only users with at least 10 approved arguments can submit a debate. For level 2 topics, the same requirement applies, but only approved debates are publicly listed. For level 3 topics, only moderators can submit debates.</p>
    <p>The system is different for debates. At security levels 0 and 1, all users can submit an argument, with the difference being that denied arguments are not visible by default for debates with a security level of 1 (but unapproved and approved arguments are). Debate security level 2 is similar to 1, but only users with at least 20 approved arguments can post. For security level 3, 20 approved arguments are required and only approved arguments are visible. For security level 4, only moderators can submit arguments.</p>
    <h2 id="order">Order of Arguments</h2>
    <p>Arguments are ordered by their approval status (approved arguments first, then unapproved arguments, then denied arguments) by default, but when there are multiple arguments with the same approval status, they are ordered by their order property (arguments with a higher order value get ranked higher), and if they share the same order, they will be ranked based on how many approved arguments the owner has.</p>
    <h2 id="topic">Owning/Moderating a Topic</h2>
    <p>To own a topic on MoDebate, you must have at least 20 approved arguments and you can also only own a maximum of 5 topics. You can, however, be the moderator of as many topics as you'd like. Please make sure to follow the User Policy and Content Policy as using your moderator powers inappropriately may result in consequences. Please don't forget to include a method for users to contact your moderator team in the topic description in case any user needs more information regarding your topic or its moderator team.</p>
    <h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>
    <p>We use a modified version of markdown on MoDebate. Keep in mind, however, that we do not support direct image linking for security purposes.</p>
